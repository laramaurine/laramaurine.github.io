           <p>I'm Lara Lesar, a current Software Ebgineering Student at Prime
            Digital Academy in Minneapolis, MN.  Like many others, Covid provided
            the opportunity to make a change in my career path.  I always
            knew tech was useful but I had never had the opportunity to create 
            anything truly useful.  So far, my favorite project was to create a to-do list
            so I can track what needs to be done and what has been done.  Being a full time student 
            and planning a move has truly tested my organizational skills and this app helps!</p>

            <p>When I'm not learning in class or studying after class I love to bake
            delicious gluten free treats.  I also love Pandas and hope to volunteer 
            with panda conservation in the future when travel is allowed and safe again.</p>
